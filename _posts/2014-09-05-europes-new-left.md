This year's edition of 'Left Thinking' —a series designed to stimulate and
focus progressive discussion on current social affairs— kicks off on Thursday,
September 25. Presented by the Rotterdam branch of the Socialist Party, `Denken
over Links' offers a podium for inspiring and thought-provoking speakers on
such diverse issues as living together in the city, racism and discrimination,
and the future of the welfare state, amongst many others. The 2014/15 season
opens with an evening of lectures and discussion concerning the perspectives
for the Left in Europe.

The European elections in May didn't produce a genuine, Europe-wide
breakthrough for the authentic Left. Despite the economic crisis, and
disastrous austerity measures, the Left, broadly speaking, appears as yet
unable to present a credible social alternative. But it's not all bad news:
Greece's _Syriza_, the figurehead for Europe's radical left, became the
leading electoral force in that country; and _Podemos_, the voice of
Spain's indignados, immediately won 8% of the vote, despite having been formed
only four months beforehand.

These parties —active in countries hit hard by the crisis, with soaring unemployment, 
deep poverty and far-reaching austerity— have managed to attract wide support 
with their radical programmes. And there are some intriguing stories behind these 
results‥

What are the perspectives for these relatively new political movements? How can 
we explain their success? How do they see the relationship between on-the-streets 
activism and parliamentary politics? These and other questions form the basis for 
lectures from representatives of both Syriza and Podemos, to be followed by an 
open discussion.

**Due to the nature of the evening, the lectures and discussion will be in English.**

Location: Gaffelstraat 61b, 20:00 – 22:00 (doors open 19:30)
